Hi...i am Rabius Sunny. this is my repo for asingment . 
add optional data remov sistem and credit qount.


Project features :
- Multiple components are used in this project to facilitate the work
- Tailwind CSS uses different CSS to give a dynamic look
- JSON data is converted and used (fake data)


How I organized the project: 
In a React project, state management typically relies on React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks for local component-level state and side effects, respectively. Additionally, global state management solutions like fake data may be employed for managing state that needs to be shared across multiple components. These tools help maintain a structured and efficient state management system in React applications.
